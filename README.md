# RPG Framework

A C++ SFML library for making turn based RPGs.
Currently in early development, the main/ folder contains a basic program for setting up a world and entering an encounter.
some test assets are included, but the backgrounds are not, there is more details in the building section.

## Building

something like 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
should generate cmake files, which can be opened or built with your IDE or build system of choice.
test-assets/backgrounds/battle-bg.png and test-assets/backgrounds/test-map.png have to be provided, the assets im using on my end do not allow distrobution in their license.
